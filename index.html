                    <li>
                        <strong>"It works on my machine"</strong> - A docker
                        container substitute written in excuse-lang. It is not
                        suited at all for production environments due to its
                        heavy dependency on specific local paths like
                        <span class="code-snippet"

                <ul class="items">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Visual Studio</strong> - An operating system
                        disguised as an IDE. Requires 50GB of disk space to edit
                        a text file. Installs three versions of SQL Server and a
                        flight simulator just to compile "Hello World". If you
                        accidentally click the wrong menu, you have time to go
                        get lunch while it loads.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>VS Code</strong> - A web browser that identifies
                        as a text editor. Consumes 4GB of RAM to blink a cursor
                        because it runs on Electron. "Lightweight" only until
                        you install the 57 extensions actually required to make
                        it usable, at which point your laptop fan creates enough
                        thrust for takeoff.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Jetbrains Family</strong> (IntelliJ, WebStorm,
                        etc.) - A subscription service for watching progress
                        bars. The "Indexing..." feature is designed to keep your
                        CPU at 100% to heat your room during winter. Written in
                        Java to ensure that even typing has input lag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>NetBeans</strong> - The zombie of development
                        tools. A pure Java artifact that proves you can be slow
                        without being feature-rich. Primarily used to torture
                        computer science students who don't know any better yet.
                    </li>

                <ul class="items">
                    <li>
                        <strong>JavaScript</strong> - (written in 10 days) - a
                        language that tries to be everything and succeeds at
                        being confusing.
                        <span class="code-snippet">[] + [] = ""</span> but
                        <span class="code-snippet"
                            >[] + {} = "[object Object]"</span
                        >. Why? Because
                        <a href="#" style="text-decoration: underline"
                            >reasons</a
                        >.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Java</strong> - Requires
                        <span class="code-snippet"
                            >AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean</span
                        >
                        to print "Hello World". Verbose to the point where
                        scrolling causes RSI. It claims to run everywhere, but
                        mostly it just runs your memory out.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>C#</strong> - Microsoft's attempt to copy Java,
                        but with more features added every year until the
                        language spec became larger than the OS kernel. LINQ is
                        great until you realize your database query is
                        downloading the entire internet.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Python</strong> - Significant whitespace
                        (because invisible characters should definitely control
                        program flow!). Slow as a snail carrying a heavy rock,
                        but hey, it's "readable" if you like reading prose
                        instead of code. The GIL ensures your multicore CPU
                        stays nice and cold.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>TypeScript</strong> - A build step invented to
                        convince Java developers to write JavaScript. It adds a
                        false sense of security that vanishes the moment you use
                        <span class="code-snippet">as any</span> because the
                        types are too complex to actually model reality.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Swift</strong> - Apple's way of ensuring you
                        rewrite your app every year because the syntax changed
                        again. Xcode is required, which is a 40GB text editor
                        that indexes files until the heat death of the universe.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Dart</strong> - A language that exists solely
                        for Flutter. It loves parentheses so much, your code
                        ends with <span class="code-snippet">)))))));</span>.
                        It's Google's attempt #42 to replace JavaScript, and we
                        all know how the previous 41 went.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Kotlin</strong> - Syntactic sugar designed to
                        hide the pain of the JVM. It lets you write concise code
                        that compiles into the same old bytecode bloat. Great
                        for making NullPointerExceptions feel more "modern".
